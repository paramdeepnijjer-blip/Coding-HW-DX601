# Coding-HW-DX601

This repository contains my DX601 Data Science homework assignments, notes. The project applies exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling, and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns in housing prices across Boston. The work includes data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation to understand which factors most strongly influence median home value.
