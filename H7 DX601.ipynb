    "\n",
    "The focus on these problems is on your understanding of the math, not the programming. Some of the data sets will be small enough that you can look at the data and calculate the answer in your head. That is acceptable, though we encourage you to also think about how to write code to perform the same calculation for you. We will work with larger data sets and provide more code examples for you as this class progress."

    "One way to estimate the mathematical constant $\\pi$ is to pick $x$ and $y$ uniformly at random from -1 to 1 and check whether they lie in the unit circle (the circle of radius one centered at the origin).\n",
    "This can be tested with the formula $x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1$.\n",
